# Message Analyzer

A small web app to show when you speak to people. You can also view the messages sent on these days.

Currently uses your messages from Facebook, which you will need to download from Facebook settings. Then ```html/messages.htm``` can be passed to the app for analysis.

All processing is done client-side so your messages don't have to be uploaded to a server.

## Running Locally

Make sure you have [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) installed.

```sh
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

Your app should now be running on [localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000/).
